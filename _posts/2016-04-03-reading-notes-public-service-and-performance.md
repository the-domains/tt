"People's behaviour is governed by the system, so when you change the system the culture changes (for free)" - John Seddon (https://01testsite01.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/culture-change-is-free.pdf) 

"If you design a system where the people who do the work have control of the work, the people change. They take responsibility. It is a Hertzberg taught: if you want people to do a good job, design a good job to do" - John Seddon 

"Meeting the measures is quite different from improving performance; it means looking good, not being good" (The Whitehall effect)
